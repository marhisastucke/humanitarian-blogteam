# humanitarian-blogteam
Creation of AStüBusiness S. A.'s blog for the global humanitarian projects work team, 
AStuck Blog Team / 2019-2020.
We are an initial team of two entrepreneurs without much computer experience,
but with many experiences in true humanitarian projects.
We are in need and bringing together professionals from tecnology who can help us voluntary
to set up our blog to develop a wonderful work of humanitarian projects.
We have no resources to pay for now, but we are expecting our own funds to raise capital
for the project, and when that happens we will do many good things for the peoples who need
help.
My name is Marhisa, I'm 52 years old, I didn't have many opportunities to study because 
my family was very poor, my university is the world, my teacher is life, and I keep
fighting to learn and know more and more.
Thank you very much all.

Marhisa AStück.
